# Emergence
Trying to demonstrate emergence phenomenon through a simple graphical side-project.

# Todo
- [x] GUI with imdearGUI in SFML.
- [x] Ability to change experiment parameters through this GUI.
- [x] Optimize step by step and have a fps counter as well as particule amount counter to compare performances with each iteration.
- [x] Add friction option.
- [x] Add temperature option.
- [x] Add fake 3D using a 3rd dimension in coordinates computations and a fake depth effect affecting particle size and bluriness.
- [x] Take into account the fact that the simulation area may not be squared (width != height), implement a grid_height and grid_width
- [x] Doppler-like effect (faster particles turn to a given color)
- [x] Choose each particle type color with a color picker
- [x] Pause button (delta_t = 0)
- [x] Load file button
- [x] Add a conservation of energy button (symmetrical interactions matrix)
- [x] Add a randomizer button for the interaction matrix
- [ ] Create a good documentation and tutorial
- [ ] Add mouse cursor interaction (repulsive/attractive force, generate/delete particles).
- [ ] Add Multithreading
- [ ] Add proceduraly generated sound/music in relation to particle behavior
- [ ] Add infinite repeating left/right and top/bottom window sides (Periodic Boundary Conditions).
